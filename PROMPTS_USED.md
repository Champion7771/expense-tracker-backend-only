## AI Usage Declaration

AI tools were utilized in this project to enhance productivity and troubleshoot environmental issues. The usage was strictly limited to the following areas:

* **Boilerplate Generation:** Assisted in generating initial setup code and standard file structures to accelerate development.
* **Logic Guidance:** Provided conceptual guidance for implementing pagination logic.
* **Troubleshooting:** Used for extensive debugging (approx. 3–4 hours) while attempting to resolve network restrictions with MongoDB Atlas.

*Note: The core business logic, schema design, and API architecture were implemented manually.*
